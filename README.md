TODO:
* minumum jam distance distribution - user set mean
* uniform distributions
* variable vehicle lengths - set by user + some variance for funsies
* vehicle weight property - normal & bimodal
* some sort of UI for parameter configuration
* truck platooning
* multi-lane behaviour?
* variable safetime headway
* force simulation speed to be bound to display update speed (optionally)

DONE:
* fix vehicle uuid seeding
* user setting of vehicle speed variance
* speed limited sections of the bridge
* bridge sensors
* some sort of display for the simulation (let's draw a bridge)
* speed up rendering by not continually drawing background
