TODO:
* multi-lane behaviour?
* replay capability for display - play back old simulations
* uniform/normal/bimodal distribution for truck weights
* multiple configuration files set as args for the simulation

DONE:
* fix vehicle uuid seeding
* user setting of vehicle speed variance
* speed limited sections of the road
* variable safetime headway sections of the road
* road sensors
* some sort of display for the simulation (let's draw a road)
* speed up rendering by not continually drawing background
* force simulation speed to be bound to display update speed (optionally)
* truck platooning
* handle the possibility of the simulation crashing due to being too slow
* variable platoon lengths
* variable platoon separation distances
* normal & uniform distributions of velocity and minimum jam distance
* variable vehicle lengths - set by user
* some sort of UI for parameter configuration - CLI
